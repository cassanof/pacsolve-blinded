## Setup / Dependencies

### Clone Repo

- Make sure to also `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the submodules. (Or do the clone recursively thing, can't remember the flag)
- After cloning repo / submodules, make sure that each submodule is pointing to the right remote / branch:
    + `cd npm/; git remote -v; git status; cd ..` should show the remote is `https://github.com/donald-pinckney/cli/`, and the branch is `latest`
    + `cd arborist/; git remote -v; git status; cd ..` should show the remote is `https://github.com/donald-pinckney/arborist`, and the branch is `main`
    + If either of these are wrong, change remotes / checkout branches appropriately.

### Setup Dependencies

- You need to have installed:
    - node (I have `v15.2.1`)
    - any somewhat recent npm (the version really shouldn't matter)
    - Racket (I have `Racket v8.0 [cs]`)
    - Rosette (Don't know how to check version of it)
    - Z3 (I have `4.8.10 - 64 bit`). Actually, I'm unsure if installing Z3 is necessary, or if Rosette packages its own Z3 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Installing My Custom Npm

- `cd npm/`
- `npm install -g`
- Then probably restart your terminal
- From anywhere, run `npm install --help`. You should see `--rosette` listed as an option. All done!

### Preconfigured Linux Virtual Machine

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
3. Clone this repo, `cd` inside the cloned directory, then `vagrant up`. Takes about 20 mins, go get some coffee
4. Run `vagrant ssh`. Great, now you are now inside the guest machine!
5. Inside the guest machine, `cd dependency-runner`

### Manual Setup

You need to get all these things installed:

- `python3.9` & `venv` (e.g. see [here](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-and-update-python-to-3-9-in-ubuntu/) for Ubuntu)
- `pip` (e.g. `apt install python3-pip`), then update setuptools:
    + `python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
    + `python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools`
    + `python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade distlib`
- `node` (e.g. with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
- `yarn` (`npm install -g yarn`)
- `verdaccio` (`npm install -g verdaccio`)
- `cargo` (`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`)
- `swift` (follow the directions for Linux [here](https://swift.org/download/))

## Running Tests

Run tests with `swift test`.
