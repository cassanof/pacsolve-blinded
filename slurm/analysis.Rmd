## Running on Discovery

I recommend viewing this with a web-based Rstudio server on Discovery:

https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/RStudio/session_contexts/new

Note that you'll need to be on Northeastern's network, or on the Northeastern VPN
(GlobalProtect).

## Initialization

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

*You may want to change this directory.*

```{r}
setwd("/work/arjunguha-research-group/minnpm-slurm/experiment")
```


Load the data:

```{r}
data <- read_csv("results.csv") %>% select(c(Project, Solver, Time))
data_wide <-pivot_wider(data, values_from=Time,names_from=Solver)
```

## Slowdown of Rosette

This is Rosette Time / Vanilla Time. Note that these times are not reliable, since we can't really do a performance benchmark on Discovery.

```{r}
slowdowns <- data_wide %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(Slowdown = rosette / vanilla)
ggplot(data = slowdowns, aes(x = Slowdown)) + stat_ecdf()

```

Median:

```{r}
median(slowdowns$Slowdown)
```

The median is shocking! Rosette is faster? Again, I don't think this is reliable.

### Failures

Analysis of failures.


```{r}
sum(is.na(data_wide$rosette))
sum(is.na(data_wide$vanilla))
```
